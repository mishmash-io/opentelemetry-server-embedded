# OpenTelemetry Data Sources for Java

This repository contains OpenTelemetry servers that can be embedded into other Java-based systems to act as data sources
for logs, metrics and traces.

Here you can also find implementations of such data sources for a few popular open source softwares and additional tools
to use when working with OpenTelemetry data.

It is also part of a broader set of [OpenTelemetry-related activities](https://mishmash.io/open_source/opentelemetry) at
[mishmash io](https://mishmash.io/).

This is the first public release of code we have accumulated internally over time and contains only a limited subset of
what we intend to share. Future releases will add modules for authentication and authorization, visualization and more.

Watch this repository for updates.
